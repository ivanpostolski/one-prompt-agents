# Filesystem Agent ‚Äì Autonomous Guide

This guide shows how to run **AutoFilesystemAgent** which reads every file it
can access, writes one-line summaries to `files_summary.txt` and keeps the HTTP
server alive for further tasks.

---

## 1  Prerequisites

1. Follow the *Interactive* guide to start the filesystem MCP server:
   ```bash
   python mcp_servers/filesystem_mcp_server.py &   # keep this running
   ```
2. Create a few sample files inside the mounted `data/` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
   echo "Apples are red."         > data/fruits.txt
   echo "Dogs are loyal mammals." > data/animals.txt
   echo "Mars is the 4th planet." > data/planets.txt
   ```
3. Export your OpenAI key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-‚Ä¶"
   ```

## 2  Run the autonomous agent

```bash
run_agent AutoFilesystemAgent "Summarise every file you can access"
```

What happens:

1. The agent plans one step per file, reads the file and appends a summary to
   `data/files_summary.txt`.
2. When all steps are finished the CLI **automatically starts** an HTTP server
   on `http://127.0.0.1:9000`.

---

## 3  Monitor the run

While the job is running you will see log messages similar to:

```
[agent] üìù Step 1/3 ‚Äì reading data/fruits.txt ‚Ä¶
[agent] üìù Step 2/3 ‚Äì reading data/animals.txt ‚Ä¶
```

Open another terminal to watch the output file grow in real time:

```bash
tail -f data/files_summary.txt | cat
```

Once you see `Job ‚Ä¶ completed` in the main terminal the summarisation round is done.

---

## 4  Send additional tasks via HTTP

Because the server is still running you can keep asking for more work.  For
example, append summaries of all Markdown files:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9000/agents/AutoFilesystemAgent" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "Append a summary for all .md files."}'
```

When you are finished, shut down the server:

```bash
shutdown_server
```

---

## 5  Inspect traces

Autonomous runs receive a different trace ID pattern:

```
autonomous-chat-<AgentName>-<JobID>
# example: autonomous-chat-AutoFilesystemAgent-8923b34c
```

Follow the same steps:
1. Open https://platform.openai.com/traces
2. Search for `AutoFilesystemAgent`.
3. Open the trace to inspect each step, tool invocation and model output.

Comparing traces from interactive (`User-Chat-‚Ä¶`) and autonomous runs is a
quick way to verify that the agent executed your plan exactly as intended.
